Another approach as follows was tried:
 
For each texel we store independently:
channel 0:
  a) signed dsitance to the closest test point (i.e. end points of Bezier curves and points where a curve is at a 45 degree angle)

  b) the usual value, i.e. the min-L1 signed distance value

channel 1: the smallest signed distance value to a point with the same x coordinate
channel 2: the smallest signed distance value to a point with the same y coordinate

Results for using a) for Channel 0:
  if(raw.x<0.5 || (raw.y<0.5 && raw.z<0.5)) discard; : horrible render results
  if(raw.x<0.5 || (raw.y<0.5 || raw.z<0.5)) discard; : horrible render results
  if(raw.x<0.5 && (raw.y<0.5 && raw.z<0.5)) discard; : horrible render results

Results for using b) for Channel 0:
  if(raw.x<0.5 && (raw.y<0.5 && raw.z<0.5)) discard; : slightly inferior to usual way render results
  if(raw.x<0.5 || (raw.y<0.5 && raw.z<0.5)) discard; : very similart to usual, several glyphs inferior
  if(raw.x<0.5 || (raw.y<0.5 || raw.z<0.5)) discard; : some glyphs don't look so good, corners not sharpened anyways
