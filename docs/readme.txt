Quick Readme for WRATH docs.
-------------------------------


Developer WRATH docs
---------------------------
To get started with WRATH, read the documentation:

make docs
you-favorite-browser docs/doxy/htm/index.html

WRATH Documentation includes a series of code examples 
whose source is listed and browsable along the rest of 
documentation. This example documentation is autogenerated 
by the script located at docs/generate_examples_docs.sh
You don't need to call the script manually, it is
called automatically every time you "make docs".

If you want to call it directly with custom parameters 
please check the instructions in the script file.
