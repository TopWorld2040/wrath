WRATH/KAN Rendering Browser vs. iOS Browser(Safari)



Recall documents: "Wrath: Nomovok UI Rendering Library"
and "WebBrowsers, QML and GL".

The main feature/advantage of WRATH rendered browser
over the iOS browser(Safari) would have it wait-free
scroll/zoom. The Safari browser works (roughly) as follows:
 1) Web content is rendered to a texture
 2) During zoom gesture, texture is scaled
 3) after zoom gesture, there is a pause where the
web content is re-rendered to the texture at the new scale
factor.
 4) scrolling is accomplished by moving the texture,
if one scrolls too far one sees "tiles" of where there
is no web content rendered. Web contents is re-rendered
after scroll gesture.

The WRATH rendered browser would NOT render to texture,
thus there is no wait after zoom and there is no region 
of tiles. 

Additionally, iOS's Safari does (but rarely) have some
rendering issues:

 1) http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/ . Under desktop,
there are two frames, the left frame being scrollable 
to select what function to query, the right frame the
man page of the function. Under iOS Safari, the scroll 
bars of both frames are missing. The page is rendered
as having only one frame, scrolling tied to both.

 2) Some web pages have a "status bar" (typically for
social networking connections), under Safari sometimes
these are not rendered or when the page scrolls they
do not stay at the bottom (one example of not being 
rendered is at http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/14/us-india-ge-idUSTRE72D26920110314

Safari also can have performance issues:
 http://themaninblue.com/experiment/AnimationBenchmark/ none of the
tests, canvas, svg or html perform very well under iPad:
  Canvas: 7.30 FPS, high zoom into bottom right corner reduces to 5FPS
  HTML: 2.3 FPS, but really odd rendering anomaly where text moves about
and a black square comes and goes from the bottom right. Under Hight zoom
performance increases to 5 FPS, and jumping of drawing area goes away.
  SVG: 3.34 FPS, zooming into corner dropped it to 2.65FPS

I _suspect_ that WRATH renderer will perform very well in the HTML.
(the performance of Canvas and SVG I do not know, but I suspect it
will not be stellar either).
