\cmd{underline on}
Using Qt Text Viewer
\cmd{pop_font_size}
\cmd{underline off}
\cmd{PP width:800}

The demo lists it's command line options
and a terse description of each with:\n\n
\cmd{push_color r:255 g:127 b:0 a:255}
./\cmd{named_link label:qt_text_viewer target:qt_text_viewer_commandline.txt r:255 g:127 b:0 a:255 underline:off} -help\cmd{pop_color}\n\n
The most important options to be aware of are:
\cmd{push_color r:255 g:255 b:0 a:255}
text_renderer,
fullscreen,
\cmd{pop_color} and \cmd{push_color r:255 g:255 b:0 a:255}
filename
\cmd{pop_color}.
The default value for \cmd{push_color r:255 g:255 b:0 a:255}
fullscreen \cmd{pop_color} is \cmd{push_color r:0 g:255 b:0 a:255}
false \cmd{pop_color}. When \cmd{push_color r:255 g:255 b:0 a:255}
fullscreen \cmd{pop_color} is \cmd{push_color r:0 g:255 b:0 a:255}
true\cmd{pop_color}, \cmd{named_link label:qt_text_viewer target:qt_text_viewer_commandline.txt r:255 g:127 b:0 a:255 underline:off} is dislayed full screen,
which is recommended for optimal performance. The parameter
\cmd{push_color r:255 g:255 b:0 a:255} filename \cmd{pop_color}
specifies what file for \cmd{named_link label:qt_text_viewer target:qt_text_viewer_commandline.txt r:255 g:127 b:0 a:255 underline:off} to load and display.
If \cmd{push_color r:255 g:255 b:0 a:255} filename \cmd{pop_color} is
the name of a path, then a file browser will be shown, see 
 \cmd{named_link label:directory_listing tag:directory_listing 
target:tutorial.txt}
Lastly, \cmd{push_color r:255 g:255 b:0 a:255} text_renderer
\cmd{pop_color} chooses how to render text. Tests indicate
that the "analytic AA" renderer, i.e. \cmd{push_color r:255 g:255 b:0 a:255}
text_renderer=\cmd{color r:0 g:255 b:0 a:255}5
\cmd{pop_color} gives good render results at reasonable performance
even on the N900. 

\n\nThe key commands are as follows: the arrow keys scroll,
the 
'\cmd{push_color r:255 g:0 b:255 a:255}a\cmd{pop_color}' 
key zooms in, the 
'\cmd{push_color r:255 g:0 b:255 a:255}s\cmd{pop_color}' 
key zooms out, 
the '\cmd{push_color r:255 g:0 b:255 a:255}r\cmd{pop_color}' key
reloads the currenlty displayed page and 
the '\cmd{push_color r:255 g:0 b:255 a:255}b\cmd{pop_color}' key
goes back one page. Each of these key choices can be changed
at the command line as well. A mouse press on a link
bring up the link and the escape key quits.

\n\nSingle touch interface is also supported.
Scrolling is standard interface where dragging
your finger scrolls the contents. Zoom is performed
as follows: touch the interface but do not move
your finger for 500ms (or more).
At which point of time, then moving your finger down
zooms in and moving your finger up zooms out. The pivot
point of the zoom is where your finger was before
zooming began. Lastly, one can initiate a zoom gesture
directly from scrolling without lifting your finger
from the device by having your finger station for 
500 ms (or more), after which time, the moving the finger
down zooms in and up zooms out. The amount of time
for the figner to stay stationary for the zoom gesture
to begin can be changed from the default of 500ms by
setting zoom_time at the command line of starting qt_text_viewer.
